\description{
The diabetes dataset has been used to illustrate network meta-analysis within the NICE-DSU TSD 2
(examples 3a and 3b). The dataset is comprised of information from 22 clinical trials examining
the effect of antihypertensive drugs (there were six treatments including a placebo arm) on the
risk of developing diabetes (a binary outcome). This dataset also contains information on the
years of follow-up within each arm.
