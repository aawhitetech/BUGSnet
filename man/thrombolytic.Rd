\description{
The thrombolytic drugs dataset compiled by Boland et al. (2003) has been used to demonstrate
indirect-treatment comparison methods within previous publications and other R packages such as
‘gemtc’.  The dataset consists of information on a binary outcome (mortality within 30 or 35
days) and eight treatments (eight different thrombolytic drugs used after a patient has had an
acute myocardial infarction) extracted from 28 clinical trials (including two, three-armed
trials).
