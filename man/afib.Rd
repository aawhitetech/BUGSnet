\title{Atrial Fibrillation data}
\format{
A dataset.
}
\usage{
data(afib)
}
\description{
The atrial fibrillation data was previously used to demonstrate the network meta-analysis
capabilities of the R package ‘gemtc’. This dataset was originally generated by Cooper et al.
(2009) and was subsequently revised by van Valkenhoef et al (2013). This dataset provides
information from 25 clinical trials examining the effects of various interventions (17) on the
risk of stroke (binary outcome) among individuals with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation. The
stroke variable is a covariate indicating the proportion of patients in the study that had a
prior stroke.
